    "\n",
    "This appears to be the culmination on the lesson of recursion. Here, we can solve [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) problem using recursion!\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going to the full explanation here, they use the lessons learnt from earlier examples to build their recursive model to show it is indeed solvable, for any size $n$!\n",

    "1. What is the base case? If $n=1$, then it is trivial to move 1 disk from peg A to peg B\n",
    "2. The next subproblem is for $n=2$, and again, it is trivial: Move disk 1 to the spare peg C, then move disk 2 to peg B, and then disk 1 on top of disk 2 on peg B.\n",
    "\n",
    "In those two examples, it is clear we can move at least 2 disks onto any peg (not necessarily B). If we can move 2 disks onto any peg, then we can also move 3 disks onto any peg, by moving 2 out the way, shifting the 3rd onto the desired peg, and then using our 2 disk mov. If we can move 3 disks, then the 4th also comes naturally, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can clearly see the recursive nature of the solution play out, when we started out at the **base case**. All the examples of recursion above have this lesson, start at the base case and work from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more interesting examples of how the Towers have been studied (such as rotating computer back ups and even ants!), see the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi#Applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "The challenge in the Khan academy tutorial has us write a function to solve the problem for any $n$ disks from peg $A$ to peg $B$. They do this in Java and depict the solution graphically!\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately python is not so good at drawing, so I will attempt a solution where each move is printed out as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will start by defining a class which will represent the Tower scenario, and a function to move a disk from one peg to another, ensuring that the move is legal. This will be the first exercise, mostly due to its abstract complexity, where an [Object-Oriented Programming](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) approach makes sense, and gives flexibility to examining the scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: The traditional solution in other coding languages involves implementing [stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), which is a data structure based around accessing the values in a Last In First Out (LIFO) manner. Python lists make decent stacks (read more detail [here](https://dbader.org/blog/stacks-in-python)), and for simplicity thats what I'll be doing here. The Tower of Hanoi is not memory intensive, but computationally intensive, so the python `list` type will be fine in this instance.\n"
